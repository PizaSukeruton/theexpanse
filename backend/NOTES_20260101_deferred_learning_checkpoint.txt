Checkpoint: Deferred Learning Injection (Option C)

- Deferred learning is session-scoped
- Replay gated by:
  - PAD delta stabilization
  - Route cooldown (no empathy/identity repair)
  - Topical continuity
  - Turn-based delay
- No probabilistic logic
- No generative AI
- Deterministic, auditable flow
