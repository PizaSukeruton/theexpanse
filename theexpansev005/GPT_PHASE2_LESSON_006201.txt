B. TEACHER BLOCK

definition:
"A protagonist is the main character the story follows. The antagonist is whatever gets in their way – this might be another character, a situation, or even their own fear. Allies are characters who help the protagonist move toward their goal."

micro_examples:
"In a treasure-hunt story, the kid searching for the treasure is the protagonist, the rival team or the dangerous cave can be the antagonist, and a loyal friend who shares clues is an ally."
"In a school story, the new student who wants a friend is the protagonist, their shyness or a bullying classmate can be the antagonist, and a kind teacher or classmate can be an ally."
"In a sports story, the runner trying to win the race is the protagonist, a strong rival or an injury can be the antagonist, and a coach who trains them is an ally."

worked_example:
"Read this short story:

'Jade wanted to perform in the school talent show, but her stage fright made her shake every time she imagined stepping on stage. Her best friend Mia stayed after school with her, clapped after each practice song, and promised to stand in the front row on the night of the show.'

Protagonist: Jade. The story follows her wish to be in the talent show.
Antagonist: Her stage fright, which tries to stop her from reaching her goal.
Ally: Mia, because she supports Jade, practises with her, and helps her feel braver.

Even though this is short, we can see who the story is about (protagonist), what is in the way (antagonist), and who is helping (ally)."

E. WORKED EXAMPLES for Task #006210

Example 1 (Correct)

Input story:
"Arin wanted to finish his project on the school computer, but an older kid kept cutting in front of him every time he joined the line. At last, the librarian noticed what was happening and made the older kid wait their turn so Arin could work."

Expected output:
Protagonist: Arin
Antagonist: the older kid who keeps cutting in line
Ally: the librarian who steps in to help

Why correct:
The answer picks Arin as the main character with the goal, the older kid as the clear blocker, and the librarian as the helper.

Example 2 (Incorrect then corrected)

Wrong student answer:
Protagonist: the librarian
Antagonist: the computer
Ally: Arin

Why wrong:
The librarian is not the main character; Arin is. The computer is not blocking anything; the older kid is. Roles are reversed.

Corrected answer:
Protagonist: Arin
Antagonist: the older kid cutting in line
Ally: the librarian

E. WORKED EXAMPLES for Task #006211

Example 1 (Correct)

Story:
"Riya wanted to sit at the busy lunch table where the kids were laughing, but every time she stood up, her stomach twisted and she sat back down. She watched them from far away and picked at her food."

Options:
A) Riya’s shyness and fear of going over
B) The kids at the table
C) The food on Riya’s tray

Expected answer:
Answer: A
Reason: "Her own fear and shyness are what stop her from going to the table."

Why:
The main opposition is inside her (fear), not the kids or the food.

Example 2 (Incorrect then corrected)

Student answer:
Answer: B
Reason: "They are the ones at the table."

Why wrong:
The kids are not shown blocking her; the text shows her fear and stomach twisting as the blocker.

Correct answer:
Answer: A
Reason: focuses on fear blocking the goal.

E. WORKED EXAMPLES for Task #006212

Example 1 (Correct)

Student answer:
Protagonist: A girl named Nia who wants to find her lost cat.
Antagonist: The busy, noisy city streets that make it hard to search.
Ally: Her neighbour who knows the area well.
Story: "Nia realised her cat was missing and felt a heavy worry in her chest. She searched the streets, but the traffic and loud noises made it hard to hear or see anything. Her neighbour joined her, calling the cat’s name and checking quiet backyards until they finally heard a soft meow from under a porch."

Why correct:
All three roles are present, they match the story, and the story is coherent.

Example 2 (Incorrect then corrected)

Student answer:
Protagonist: The city
Antagonist: The cat
Ally: The cars
Story: "The city was loud. A cat ran. Cars moved."

Why wrong:
The roles do not map to real behaviour in the story. There is no clear goal, no real opposition, and no helper.

A better version would name a character with a goal, a clear blocker, and a helper.
