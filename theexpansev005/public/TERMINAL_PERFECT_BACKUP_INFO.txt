TERMINAL WINDOW SYSTEM - PERFECT STATE
Date: November 15, 2025, 20:15
Status: ✅ PRODUCTION READY

WHAT WORKS:
- Three independent window frames (left, top-right, bottom-right)
- Each frame has outer locked container + inner sliding content
- Identical animation effects (0.6s ease, 100% translateX/Y)
- All windows slide completely off-screen revealing locked frames
- Perfect symmetry across all three panels
- Layout locked and immutable

STRUCTURE:
- #left-panel (outer) → #left-window (frame) → #left-window-inner (content)
- #right-panel (outer) → .top-right-window (frame) → #top-right-window-inner (content)
- #right-panel (outer) → .bottom-right-window (frame) → #bottom-right-window-inner (content)

FILES:
- public/terminal_new.html (main interface)
- public/window-manager.js (toggle logic)

NEXT STEPS:
- WindowManager API ready to load content
- GodMode Menu can control window content
- Admin utility can be built on top of this foundation

CRITICAL: Layout must NEVER change from this state
