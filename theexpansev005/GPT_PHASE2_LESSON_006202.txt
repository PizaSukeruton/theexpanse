B. TEACHER BLOCK

definition:
"An internal conflict happens inside a character – their thoughts, feelings, fears, or hard decisions. An external conflict happens outside the character – other people, nature, rules, or situations that block their goal. Many strong stories use both at the same time: the character struggles inside while also facing problems in the world."

micro_examples:
"Internal: A student wants to answer a question in class but feels too anxious and keeps their hand down."
"External: A storm knocks out the power so a family cannot finish cooking dinner."
"Both: A kid wants to apologise to a friend (internal conflict: shame and fear) while the friend walks away and will not talk to them (external conflict: another person)."

worked_example:
"Read this short scene:

'Ken’s friends begged him to sneak out at night to explore an old factory. He felt a rush of excitement, but his stomach tightened when he imagined his parents waking up and finding his bed empty. The group waited by the gate, whispering for him to hurry, while the wind rattled the factory’s broken windows.'

Internal conflict: Ken is pulled between excitement and guilt. Inside, he is worried about breaking trust with his parents but also wants to be part of the group.
External conflict: His friends are pressuring him at the gate, and the situation (a dangerous, broken factory at night) adds outside risk.

This shows how internal and external conflicts can work together: his feelings pull him one way, the outside situation and people pull another."

E. WORKED EXAMPLES for Task #006220

Example 1 (Correct)

Description:
"Lena wanted to tell her friend she was upset, but every time she walked over, her throat felt tight and she turned away."

"A tree fell across the only road out of town, blocking every car from leaving."

Expected answer:
Answer: External
Reason: "The fallen tree is an outside obstacle that blocks the road."

2: "Student selects the summary that most clearly shows an inner decision, fear, or emotional struggle."

E. WORKED EXAMPLES for Task #006221

Example 1 (Correct)

Summaries:
A) "Mara wanted to climb the tall ladder, but heavy rain made each step slippery."
B) "Teo kept arguing with himself about whether to tell the truth or hide what he did."
C) "A bus broke down on the way to the match, so the team arrived late."

Expected answer:
Answer: B
Reason: "Teo is fighting with his own thoughts about telling the truth, which is an inside struggle."

Example 2 (Incorrect then corrected)

Student answer:
Answer: A
Reason: "She might feel scared to climb."

Why wrong:
A focuses mainly on the external problem (rain and slippery ladder). The fear is not clearly stated; the main conflict is the conditions.

Correct answer is B, with a reason about arguing with himself.

2: "Labels fit the story well: inner feelings vs outside situation are correctly separated."

story_clarity

total_possible_score: 6

grade_mapping:
{ "min_score": 0, "max_score": 1, "fsrs_grade": 1 }
{ "min_score": 2, "max_score": 3, "fsrs_grade": 2 }
{ "min_score": 4, "max_score": 5, "fsrs_grade": 3 }
{ "min_score": 6, "max_score": 6, "fsrs_grade": 4 }

E. WORKED EXAMPLES for Task #006222

Example 1 (Correct)

Student answer:
Internal conflict: "Luca is scared of performing in front of people but also really wants to show his song."
External conflict: "The school rule says he must audition in front of a panel, and the sign-up sheet closes today."
Story: "Luca stared at the talent show sign-up sheet, his pen hovering above the paper. He imagined standing on the stage, feeling his hands shake and his voice crack. At the same time, he knew the rules said this was the last day to sign up, and the teachers were already putting the sheet away. He took a deep breath, wrote his name quickly, and handed the paper in before he could change his mind."

Example 2 (Incorrect then corrected)

Student answer:
Internal conflict: "He runs fast."
External conflict: "The race is long."
Story: "He ran and ran. The race was long. He finished."

Why wrong:
There is no clear inner struggle described, and the outside challenge is not explained as a real conflict; it is just a description.

A better version would name a real inner worry and a clear outside difficulty.
