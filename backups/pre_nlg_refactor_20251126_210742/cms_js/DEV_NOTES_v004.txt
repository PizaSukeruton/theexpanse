THE EXPANSE CMS - v004 INTEGRATION NOTES
========================================
Date: November 24, 2025
Status: STABLE / WIRED

1. UI OVERHAUL
   - Converted adminMenu.js from inline styles to cms-styles.css classes.
   - Implemented Terminal/Sci-Fi aesthetic (green borders, glowing text).
   - Added System Offline placeholders for missing modules.

2. CHARACTER MANAGEMENT
   - View All: Now fetches from /api/cms/characters and caches data.
   - Dashboard: Added Master-Detail view. Clicking a name loads the right panel.
   - Create: POST /api/cms/characters (Fixed form, added Image URL).
   - Edit: PUT /api/cms/characters/:id (Pre-fills form, saves changes).
   - Inventory: Wired to /api/cms/character/:id/inventory (Currently Offline/Placeholder).
   - Traits: Wired to /api/traits/character/:id (Displays raw JSON matrix).

3. LORE / STORY ARCS
   - Wired to backend/routes/lore-admin.js.
   - View: GET /api/lore/arcs.
   - Create: POST /api/lore/arcs.

4. MISSING ROUTES (To Build Next)
   - Inventory API (backend/api/character.js needs an inventory endpoint).
   - Narrative Segments (backend/api/narrative-segments.js).
