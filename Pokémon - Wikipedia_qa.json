From 1998 to 2000, Pok\u00e9mon was exported to the rest of the world, creating an unprecedented global phenomenon dubbed \"Pok\u00e9mania\". By 2002, the craze had ended, after which Pok\u00e9mon became a fixture in popular culture, with new products releasing to this day. In the summer of 2016, the franchise spawned a second craze with the release of Pok\u00e9mon Go, an augmented reality game developed by Niantic.",
