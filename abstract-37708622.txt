Aphantasia is a neurocognitive phenomenon affecting voluntary visual imagery, 
such that it is either entirely absent, or markedly impaired. Using both the 
social and medical models of disability, this article discusses the extent to 
which aphantasia can be understood as a disorder or just a form of neutral 
neurodivergence, given that imagery plays a central role in thinking and memory 
for most other people. Preliminary school performance data are presented, 
showing that low imagery does not necessarily complicate life, especially given 
compensatory strategies and low societal barriers. In addition, we discuss the 
consequences of labelling aphantasia a disorder with regard to self- and public 
stigma, and we provide further data regarding a confidence gap, by which 
aphantasics perceive themselves as performing worse than they objectively do. We 
conclude that aphantasia should be understood as neutral neurodivergence and 
that labelling it a disorder is not only wrong, but potentially harmful.
